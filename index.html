      <h3>Vimal Vivegananda</h3>
      <p> Before I started the Programming Bootcamp I had only a little bit of experience when it came to programming and I had never used the Processing software before.My aim during this project, as I am sure was the aim for many during this project, was to improve my programming skills and become a better programmer in terms of how to tackle an issue.Over the last 2 weeks I have been able to get an understanding of various different programming concepts that I did not have before coming to University.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: US Senate Voting Helper</h3>
    <p>
	The US Senate Voting Helper is the project that concludes my 2 weeks of the Programming Bootcamp at City. It is a program that helps people with the voting process with the upcoming Elections in the USA. It will tell you who your Senators are when you enter your State and it will also tell you what year that they are up for Election.This Programming project has helped me to develop and understanding of conditionals,variables and user interaction.Whilst you are typing your State name there will be music playing in the background to help you through the process and there will be Images depicting what you are voting. I hope you have fun with your project and please read the README file before using the program.
